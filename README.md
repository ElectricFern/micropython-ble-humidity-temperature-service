# Low energy Bluetooth Temperature and Humidity for Arduino Nano 33 Sense Rev 2

OpenMV IDE is bundled with some example scripts. One of which is for temperature and bluetooth.

This is my work in progress code to be able to send both humidity and temperature data out via bluetooth to a connected device.

## Tools
- Arduino IDE to configure the micropython bootloader onto the microcontroller
- OpenMV IDE to code and load the micropython code onto the microcontroller
- Git for version controll and sharing to the community.
